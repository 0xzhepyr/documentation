OxVenta AI allows anyone to create and deploy their own ERC-20 tokens using a simple, conversational interface. No coding experience or developer tools are required. Tokens can be generated and published on supported blockchains within seconds.

## **Basic Token Parameters**

The AI agent accepts the following token parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `name`     | The full display name of the token         |
| `symbol`   | The ticker symbol (e.g., MYT, USDT)        |
| `supply`   | Total supply to be minted                  |
| `decimals` | Decimal precision (default is 18)          |
| `mintable` | (Optional) Whether the token can be minted |
| `burnable` | (Optional) Whether the token can be burned |
| `taxes`    | (Optional) Transfer tax settings           |

## [**Example Commands**](https://docs.oxventa.io/#example-commands)

```
Create a token called "LoyaltyToken" with symbol LTY and supply 1,000,000
```

```
Create token "AlphaCoin" symbol ALPHA, 500,000 supply, burnable, no minting
```

The agent will:

1. Parse the input
2. Confirm token configuration with you
3. Generate a verified ERC-20 smart contract
4. Estimate gas and deploy it
5. Return the token address and explorer link

## **Token Types**

### **Standard ERC-20**

- Fixed supply
- No extra logic

### **Advanced Tokens (optional)**

- Mintable
- Burnable
- Taxable (e.g., 1% on transfer)
- Ownership controls

> **_Token features are optional and can be enabled via command._**

## **Deployment Flow**

1. User sends token creation command
2. Agent parses and validates parameters
3. Smart contract is generated
4. User confirms and pays gas
5. Token is deployed to selected network
6. Address and metadata are returned

## **Deployment Output Example**

```
âœ… Token Deployed!Name: MyToken: MYT Total Supply: 1,000,000Decimals: 18Contract Address: 0xAbC123...defView on EtherScan: https://etherscan.com/token/0xAbC...
```

## **Fees**

- Users must cover network gas fees
- Token creation service is free during beta (subject to change)
- Optional features (e.g. audit, verification) may incur additional charges in future versions
