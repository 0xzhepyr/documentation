OxVenta AI includes an integrated wallet management system that allows users to interact with their blockchain assets without relying on external extensions or third-party wallets. Wallets are automatically generated and maintained during user sessions, enabling seamless DeFi interaction inside the AI interface.

## **Key Features**

- Session-based wallet generation
- Private key never stored or exposed
- Full control over balances and transactions
- Optional manual wallet import
- Multi-chain address support

## **Wallet Types**

### **1. Session Wallet (default)**

- Automatically created on first use
- Used for swaps, token creation, and liquidity
- Private key exists only in encrypted runtime memory
- Automatically invalidated after session ends

### **2. Imported Wallet (optional)**

- Users can import a private key or mnemonic manually
- Recommended for advanced users or persistent strategies
- No key is ever transmitted or saved externally

## **Commands**

```
/show wallet
```

Displays your current session wallet address.

```
/show balances
```

Lists current token balances on supported networks.

```
/import wallet <private-key>
```

Imports your own wallet for full control.

```
/reset wallet
```

Destroys the current session wallet and generates a new one.

## **Supported Networks**

- Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Base
- Ethereum (planned)
- Polygon (planned)

Each network has its own address, tracked internally by the agent.

## **Security Considerations**

- Wallets are non-custodial and user-owned
- All transactions require explicit confirmation
- Session wallets are short-lived and purged on timeout
- Private keys are encrypted in memory only and never stored
- Users can manually revoke, reset, or replace wallets

## **Transaction Signing**

Transactions initiated by the user are:

1. Constructed by the AI agent
2. Signed internally using the session or imported wallet
3. Broadcast to the appropriate blockchain network
4. Responded with a transaction hash and explorer link

No transactions are signed without user confirmation.

## **Viewing Wallet Activity**

OxVenta provides on-demand insights for wallet activity.

```
/show transactions
```

Displays recent transaction history.

```
/check token <symbol>
```

Shows balance and metadata for a specific token.

## **Example Output**
