At the core of OxVenta’s interaction layer is the AI Agent — a conversational engine that interprets user commands and transforms them into executable DeFi transactions. The agent leverages state-of-the-art language modeling and secure execution to deliver an intuitive DeFi experience.

## **Natural Language Commands (Telegram / Discord)**

OxVenta supports user interaction through plain-text input in messaging platforms.

### **Supported Platforms**

- **Telegram** (live)
- **Discord** (planned)
- **X / Twitter DM** (planned)

### **Example Commands**

```
Swap 1 ETH to USDT
Create a token called "MyToken" with symbol MYT and 1 million supply
Provide liquidity for MYT/ETH
Check wallet balanceShow my last 5 transactions
```

The agent will respond with confirmations, status, or prompts for missing info. Future support for voice and multi-language input is planned.

## **How LangChain & Qwen 32B Work Together**

The AI agent architecture is powered by two major components:

### **Qwen 32B**

- A large language model (LLM) optimized for command understanding
- Performs semantic interpretation of user input
- Handles token extraction, context parsing, and logical inference

### **LangChain**

- Connects the language model with execution tools
- Manages stateful conversation sessions
- Provides routing between AI output and blockchain infrastructure
- Allows function calling (e.g., swap(), deployToken()) via tools

Together, Qwen understands _what_ the user wants, and LangChain figures out _how_ to execute it on-chain.

## **Security & Authentication Flow**

Each command is verified and authenticated before any blockchain interaction occurs.

### **Flow**

1. **Command received** from user (via Telegram/Discord).
2. **Intent parsed** and command is validated.
3. **Session wallet** or imported key is verified.
4. **Transaction simulation** is performed.
5. **Confirmation prompt** is sent to user.
6. **Transaction signed** and broadcasted.
7. **Success message** and transaction hash returned.

No transactions are executed without user approval.

### **Security Features**

- Encrypted session identity (per user)
- AI-based fraud and anomaly detection
- Rate-limiting and abuse prevention
- On-chain audit logging (optional)

## **Prompt Optimization Tips**

To improve clarity and performance when interacting with the AI agent:

### **Do**

<Check>
  - Use direct language\
    `Swap 50 USDT to ETH`
  - Be specific with amounts and tokens\
    `Create token named TravelToken with 1,000,000 supply`
  - Specify chains if needed\
    `Swap 2 ETH to USDC on Base`
</Check>

### **Avoid** 

<Danger>
  - Vague requests like “Make me rich”
  - Ambiguous token names (“USD” could be multiple assets)
  - Running multiple commands in one sentence
</Danger>
