Security is a first-class priority in OxVenta AI. Every interaction is monitored, validated, and protected by a layered security model combining audited contracts, AI-driven fraud detection, user rate limiting, and on-chain transparency.

## **Smart Contract Audit Reports**

All core smart contracts used by OxVenta are audited before being deployed to mainnet.

### **Audit Process**

- Internal code reviews by the OxVenta engineering team
- External audits by independent third-party firms (in progress)
- Post-deployment monitoring for known vulnerability signatures

### **Public Reports**

Audit reports will be published at:

```
-
```

Each contract includes a changelog and verification hash to ensure that the deployed bytecode matches the audited version.

## **AI Fraud Detection**

OxVenta uses AI models to detect suspicious behavior in real time.

### **Detection Techniques**

- Pattern matching against common DeFi attack vectors
- Behavioral anomaly detection based on wallet activity
- Signature verification and permission analysis
- Transaction frequency and volume thresholds

### **Example Triggers**

- Rapid token minting followed by liquidity removal
- Repeated swap failures or gas exhaustion
- Sudden token price manipulations

If fraud is suspected, the agent will:

1. Halt execution
2. Inform the user
3. Log the event for review

> **_AI detection runs independently of the blockchain layer and does not interfere with successful transactions unless malicious intent is flagged._**

## **User Authentication & Rate Limiting**

Each interaction with the OxVenta AI agent is tied to a unique session identifier.

### **Authentication Flow**

- Session created upon user start
- Temporary wallet assigned and linked to identity
- All transactions are gated by session authentication

### **Rate Limits**

To prevent abuse and protect infrastructure:

- Swap requests: limited to X/min per user
- Token creation: limited per session
- Liquidity actions: capped based on value and frequency

Abuse attempts may result in temporary suspension of session activity.

## **Transparency & On-Chain Verification**

OxVenta emphasizes traceability and user verification of all activity.

### **Features**

- Every transaction returns a block explorer link
- Token contracts are published and verified (where possible)
- LP pools and token metadata are viewable on-chain
- Optional full session logs (user-controlled)

### **Example Response**
