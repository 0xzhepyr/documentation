---

OxVenta AI is accessible directly through Telegram, allowing users to interact with DeFi using natural language. No apps, extensions, or dashboards required â€” all actions can be performed inside a private chat with the AI agent.

## **Start the Bot**

To begin using OxVenta AI on Telegram:

1. Open Telegram and search for `@OxVenta_defi_bot`
2. Tap the **Start** button
3. The bot will greet you and provide a short onboarding prompt

The session will automatically generate a secure internal wallet for you to use during your interaction. You can also import your own key or wallet later.

## **Supported Commands**

You can use natural language commands to perform various actions. Below are examples:

### **Token Operations**

```
Create token "MyToken" with symbol MYT and supply 1,000,000
```

### **Swaps**

```
Swap 50 USDT to ETH
```

### **Liquidity**

```
Provide liquidity for MYT/ETH with 1 ETH and 50000 MYT
```

### **Wallet**

```
Show my balancesCheck my recent transactions
```

## **Transaction Flow**

1. You send a command (e.g. "Swap 1 BNB to USDT").
2. The AI parses and validates the input.
3. It prepares the transaction using your active wallet session.
4. You receive a confirmation message with estimated gas.
5. The transaction is signed and broadcasted.
6. A success message with a block explorer link is returned.

## **Session Management**

OxVenta AI uses temporary session wallets unless a private key is imported.

- Sessions are active only while the chat is ongoing
- You can end or reset the session by typing:

```
/end session
```

or

```
/reset wallet
```

- You can view your current wallet address by typing:

```
/show wallet
```

## **Security Notes**

- All signing is done within your Telegram session context
- OxVenta does not store or export private keys
- You are responsible for importing or exporting private keys securely
- All operations are logged on-chain for transparency

## **Tips**

- Always ensure you have gas (e.g., BNB on BSC) to cover transactions
- Use exact token symbols or contract addresses when possible
- Use `/help` to list supported command formats
