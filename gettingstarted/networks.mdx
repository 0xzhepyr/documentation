OxVenta AI is built to be **multi-chain** and **wallet-agnostic**, enabling secure interaction with various blockchains through a session-based wallet model. Unlike traditional Web3 dApps that rely on browser extensions, OxVenta abstracts wallet management to simplify user experience while maintaining full security and control.

## **Internal Wallet Management**

OxVenta uses a **session-based wallet system** that allows users to perform blockchain actions without setting up external wallets or extensions.

### **Key Features**

- A temporary, non-custodial wallet is generated at session start.
- The private key is encrypted in memory (never persisted).
- All signing and transaction logic happens within the AI runtime.
- Sessions are automatically invalidated after logout or timeout.
- Users may optionally import their own private key or mnemonic phrase.

> **_This approach provides a secure balance between usability and decentralization, especially for users unfamiliar with Web3 tooling._**

## **Wallet Modes**

### **1. Session Wallet (Default)**

- Automatically created during the first interaction
- Requires no manual setup or third-party wallet
- Recommended for short sessions, simple swaps, and token deployment

### **2. Imported Wallet (Advanced)**

- Users may import a private key or mnemonic for persistent wallet control
- Suitable for users conducting high-value transactions or managing portfolios
- Signing still occurs client-side; OxVenta never stores sensitive data

> **_Both modes operate under the same session environment and allow full feature access across supported networks._**

## **Transaction Lifecycle**

1. The user submits a command (e.g., `Swap 1 BNB to USDT`)
2. OxVenta checks session wallet status and balance
3. The AI agent validates input and simulates the transaction
4. The transaction is constructed and signed internally
5. The signed transaction is broadcast to the blockchain
6. The user receives a confirmation with a transaction hash and explorer link

## **Security Model**

- **Non-Custodial**: Private keys are never stored or transmitted externally
- **Ephemeral**: Wallets are valid only for the duration of the session
- **Isolated**: Each user operates in an isolated, encrypted execution context
- **Permissioned Signing**: No transaction is sent without explicit user approval
- **Session Management**: Users can revoke or reset their wallet at any time

> **_This model ensures users maintain control of their funds while benefiting from a frictionless DeFi experience._**
