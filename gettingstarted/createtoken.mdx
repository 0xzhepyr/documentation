OxVenta AI enables anyone to deploy a fully functional ERC-20 token without writing code. The process is entirely managed by an AI agent through a conversational interface on **Telegram**, allowing for rapid token creation across supported blockchains.

This guide walks you through how to create and deploy your own token in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A valid [**<u>Telegram</u>**](https://telegram.org/) account
- Access to the official OxVenta AI bot: `@oxventa_bot`
- Sufficient native tokens (e.g., BNB, ETH) in your wallet to cover gas fees
- (Optional) A wallet app such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet

## Step-by-Step Guide

- Open Telegram and search for `@oxventa_bot`
- Tap **Start** to initiate a session
- The AI agent will guide you through supported commands

> **_You may use the default session wallet or connect your own wallet via WalletConnect (if supported)._**

## Send a Token Creation Command

Use plain English to define your token parameters. For example:

```
Create a token named MyToken with symbol MYT and supply 1,000,000
```

The agent will:

- Parse and validate your request
- Summarize your token configuration
- Prompt you for confirmation before deployment

You may also include optional features:

```
Create a token called MyTijeb with symbol MT, 500 million supply, 8 decimals, burning enabled, no minting
```

## Approve the Transaction

Once confirmed:

- Gas fees will be estimated and displayed
- You will be prompted to sign the transaction using:
  - WalletConnect (external wallet)
  - In-session wallet (secure, temporary)

> **_OxVenta never stores private keys. Signing occurs locally or through trusted integrations._**

## Smart Contract Deployment

Upon approval, the AI agent will:

- Generate a compliant ERC-20 contract
- Deploy it on the selected blockchain
- Return essential details:

```
âœ… Token Deployed Successfully

Name: MyToken
Symbol: MYT
Total Supply: 1,000,000

Contract Address: 0xAbC123...789
View on BscScan: https://bscscan.com/token/0xAbC123...789
```

## Add Liquidity (Optional)

You may immediately pair your token with a base asset (e.g., BNB or ETH) to enable trading:

```
Pair MYT with 1 ETH
```

The agent will:

- Create a new liquidity pool on a supported DEX
- Deposit both assets and return:
  - LP token address
  - Trading link (e.g., Uniswap)

> **_Adding liquidity increases usability and accessibility of your token._**

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use a unique name and symbol to prevent confusion with existing tokens.
- Choose a realistic total supply based on your use case.
- Consider enabling minting/burning only if necessary.
- Add liquidity early for better discoverability and trading support.
