description: "Learn about the EVM and non-EVM networks supported by the OxVenta AI protocol."

OxVenta AI is designed as a **chain-agnostic DeFi automation protocol**, supporting both **EVM-compatible** and **non-EVM blockchains**. This architecture enables users to execute transactions, manage assets, and move liquidity seamlessly across multiple blockchain environments—all through a single AI-powered interface.

## Importance of Multi-Chain Support

In today’s DeFi ecosystem, liquidity, user activity, and innovation are distributed across various Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains. OxVenta bridges these fragmented environments by enabling **cross-chain operations** through integrated routing logic, smart contract interoperability, and bridge protocol support.

## EVM-Compatible Chains

OxVenta supports and actively expands across Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, which share the same execution logic and developer tooling.

### Currently Supported

- **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**\
  Low-cost, high-speed transactions ideal for high-frequency DeFi operations.

### Upcoming Integrations

- **Ethereum Mainnet**\
  High liquidity and composability with existing DeFi protocols.
- **Polygon**\
  Scalable Layer 2 solution with low transaction costs.
- **Base (by Coinbase)**\
  Developer-friendly Layer 2 built on the OP Stack with growing adoption.
- **Arbitrum and Optimism**\
  General-purpose Layer 2 rollups for scalable and cost-effective DeFi.

> **_EVM compatibility allows OxVenta to deploy and interact with smart contracts across chains using standardized logic and tooling._**

## Non-EVM Chains (Planned)

To support broader adoption and future DeFi ecosystems, OxVenta plans to integrate non-EVM chains using custom execution layers and cross-chain adapters.

### Planned Integrations

- **Solana**\
  High-performance Layer 1 with parallel execution and minimal fees.
- **Cosmos SDK Chains**\
  An ecosystem of interoperable networks connected via IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), including ATOM, Osmosis, and others.

> **_These chains require chain-specific interaction logic, which will be abstracted by OxVenta’s AI and bridging infrastructure._**

## Cross-Chain Protocol Integrations

OxVenta integrates with leading cross-chain protocols to support interoperability and reliable asset transfer.

| Protocol  | Functionality                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LayerZero | Lightweight messaging between smart contracts across EVM chains  |
| Wormhole  | Asset bridging between EVM and non-EVM networks including Solana |
| Axelar    | Secure cross-chain contract invocation and token transfers       |

The AI agent uses these integrations to automatically route and execute user transactions across chains with minimal friction.

## Security and Testing

Each supported blockchain undergoes an internal validation process to ensure consistent behavior, optimal performance, and secure transaction handling.

- Smart contract audit alignment per chain environment
- Transaction simulation and cost estimation
- Bridge and router testing for asset delivery guarantees
- AI-based risk detection across multi-chain flows

> **_OxVenta ensures every cross-chain interaction is secure, optimized, and verifiable—while keeping the user experience unified and intuitive._**

## Summary

OxVenta’s multi-chain support enables users to access DeFi opportunities across major blockchain ecosystems without switching platforms or managing multiple wallets. Whether interacting with EVM-compatible chains or emerging non-EVM networks, the protocol ensures consistent functionality, high performance, and automated cross-chain execution powered by AI.
